Welcome to avatar², the target orchestration framework with focus on dynamic
 analysis of embedded devices' firmware!

Avatar² is developed and maintained by [Eurecom's S3 Group](http://s3.eurecom.fr/).

# Building

Building avatar² is easy!

First, make sure that all the dependencies are present:

```
sudo apt-get install python-pip python-setuptools python-dev cmake
```

Afterwards, the following three commands are enough to install the core.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/avatartwo/avatar2.git
$ cd avatar2
$ sudo pip install .
```
Afterwards, the different target endpoints can be built, such as QEmu or PANDA.
For doing so, we are providing build-scripts for Ubuntu 16.04 - while other
distributions are not officially supported (yet), the scripts are known to
work with slight modifications on other distributions as well.
```
$ cd targets
$ ./build_*.sh
```
